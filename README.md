# Bầu cua cá cọp - Rust
It's Lunar New Year 2024 and I'm learning Rust.
Way back in the day I was learning Python in AP Computer Science and
LNY rolled around. Deciding it'd be a fun activity, I decided to write
a simple computerized version of "bầu cua cá cọp", a game often played
by Vietnamese for Tết Nguyên Đán (a.k.a. Lunar New Year) in Python.

Fast forward to 2024 I figured I'd make it a tradition for whatever language
I am learning, and now it happens to be Rust.
This was just a fun little exercise and not meant to be perfectly idiomatic
Rust since I'm still in the middle of learning the basics 😅. I'll probably
go back and fix things or add features, who knows.

# Bầu cua cá cọp
It's Lunar New Year 2024 and I'm learning Rust.
Way back in the day I was learning Python in AP Computer Science, and
LNY rolled around. Deciding it'd be a fun activity, I decided to write
a simple computerized version of "bầu cua cá cọp", a game often played
by Vietnamese for Tết Nguyên Đán (a.k.a. Lunar New Year) in Python.

Fast forward to 2024 I figured I'd make it a tradition for whatever language
I am learning, and now it happens to be Rust.
